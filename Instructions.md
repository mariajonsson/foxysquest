How to play
===========

Goal
-----

The objective of the game is to find a way out of the forest. This is done by exploring the world and the playing the levels. 

Moving around
----

You move around with the key arrows. In "map"-mode, you can move up, down, left, right. In platform mode you can move left and right, and jump. The controls for jumping can be a bit tricky at first. When you start jumping, just press "up"-key. Don't press left or right immediately after jumping. Start moving left or right when in the air.

Restart
----

If you want to restart the game, you can reload the page (Ctrl+R) at any time in the game. 

If you die (game over) you can press Space key and you get to start over.

Rules
----

#### Life

A heart means you get to try again if you die in one level. As long as you have hearts the game restarts in that level and you lose one heart, your score and your items.

You start the game with one heart and can collect more along the way.

#### Score

You get points for catching certain objects: fruits, sweets, coins and gems. Different objects result in different scores.

#### Items

You can collect certain items in your inventory for later use. Keys, for instance.
